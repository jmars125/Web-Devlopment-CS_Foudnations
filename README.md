<h1>Web Development & Computer Science Foundations</h1>

<br>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>I've forked this git repository from  <a href="https://github.com/MrDotDarko/Web-Development-CS-Foundations">MrDotDarko </a> to document the development of my skills and knowledge in web development and build a strong foundational base in the relevant computer science subjects</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
The greatest thing about the internet is the democratisation of information. Like no other time in history, more people from more backgrounds and circumstances have access to the resources and information that they wouldn't have previously. Through hardwork, dedication and coffee, I hope to be a shining example of what can be accomplished with a laptop and some free-time.<p>
<p>This project exists mainly to demonstrate to others my self-learning process. I've included the notes and projects for anybody to look at and get an idea of how I have progressed and developed myself as a developer.</p>

<p>Also here you can find the path I have been following commencing on the 19th of July 2017. <br/> <a href="https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md"> Web Development with Computer Science Foundations - comprehensive path by @P1xt. </a></p>

</ul><br>
<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
<ul>
<li>have git commits every week, most of the days of the week</li>
<li>try to get in one of <a class="mention" href="https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/tropicalchancer">@tropicalchancer</a>'s cohorts - be active once you're in</li>
<li>code in your own editor, if you don't know where to start start with Brackets</li>
<li>try to pick at least one language besides JavaScript, and solve some of the algorithmic challenges with that language (Good choices: Java, Python, Golang, Rust)</li>
</ul>
<h4>For each item you should:</h4>
<ul>
<li>take notes, on a blog, in markdown, wherever, somewhere - not about what you read, or about what the instructor said - about what you learned</li>
<li>build something - even if it's just a 20 line function that computes something you find interesting</li>
<li>code in your own editor - if you don't know which to pick, start with Brackets</li>
<li>if you build something, document it and test it as appropriate</li>
<li>do the exercises, build the projects - fully, not some scaled down halfassery</li>
</ul>
<h4>For four (or more) projects of your choosing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seek 1-3 other developers to collaborate on the project</li>
<li>Coordinate with the team to complete the project</li>
<li>Build the project out to a full production quality application</li>
<li>Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigorously test the final product.</li>
<li>Resolve any legitimate issues found</li>
</ul>
<h4>Once per month - do two or more of the following:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what you learned that month</li>
<li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo">this video</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo">this video</a>&nbsp;- on interviewing</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html">this</a>&nbsp;- on crafting a resume</li>
<li>Do one lesson from <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345">CUST104: Business Communications</a></li>
<li>Live stream what you're working on for an hour. Or, lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.</li>
<li>Catch up on industry reading on sites like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>, <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles">A List Apart</a>, <a href="http://uxmyths.com/">UX Myths</a>, <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>If you need a breather from an item, do one of these, then get back to it</h4>
<ul>
<li>complete a project from FCC that isn't included in this list</li>
<li>pick a pet web development project you can code in a week and complete it</li>
<li>write a guide for the FCC wiki or create a video tutorial and post it to YouTube</li>
<li>redo any of the algorithmic type projects you've already completed from the list, in a language other than JavaScript</li>
<li>pick an open source project from <a href="https://www.codetriage.com/">Code Triage</a>&nbsp;and contribute to fixing an open issue</li>
<li>visit the FCC forum and pick a couple of the toughest questions, that people are having trouble getting help with, and help them</li>
<li>code a flash cards application, for jotting quick notes you can use to quiz yourself later</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Don't ask me how long this will take you. I do not know your aptitude, determination, or propensity for flitting off to check Facebook every 5 minutes, nor do I know how much time you have available to devote daily. Begin working through it and gauge for yourself the speed with which you progress. I promise you, if you just start from the top and work your way down, you won't accidentally learn something useless while you figure out your learning pace.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I took some care to ensure that this list contains only resources which are legitimately free. You may need to give Heroku a credit card if you host all your projects there. If you don't want to /can't do that, just deploy locally, deploy to heroku, and then delete the app from heroku once you've moved on to a different project (that won't work for FCC certification because it needs to be accessible to meet the guidelines, but for the purposes of this list, once you're done with a project, I don't see a lot of value in persisting it on the web while you're working on something else --- UNTIL, you need to polish your portfolio for a job application, then you would want to have your best projects running online).</p>
<p>Although I took heavy inspiration from many resources when creating this guide, none of it is a cut and paste path from somewhere else. Often, I substituted courses (especially in the case of Coursera) to ensure that the entire course was available for free and required no purchases of any kind. Where possible, I tried to align projects to reinforce prior learning.</p>
